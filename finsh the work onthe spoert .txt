//theary
hear we see one arry is has in un shorted and short value so we fier loop and commper with key when this found then we take break,chang flag=1 and jump out of the loop and chack counditon if flage=1 then it's found otherwies ti;s not fund.

//logic
int key,flage,i,n,a[50];

get key
flage=0;
for(i=0;i<n;i++)
{
	if(a[i]==key)
	{
		flage=1;
		break
	}
}
if(flage==1)
{
	printf("%d is found",key);
}
else
{
	printf("%d is not found",key);
